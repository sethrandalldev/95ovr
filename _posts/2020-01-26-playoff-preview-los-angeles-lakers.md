**The Good**

For a team that is looking like the number one seed in the western conference, there is a lot to like. For starters, Lebron James and Anthony Davis might be the top duo in the league. They have all the physical abilities that a top duo needs and with Lebron's court vision (10.7 assists per game) and AD finding a reliable three-point shot (39% from behind the arc in 8 January games), these two are tough to guard when both of them are on the floor.

For the rest of the line-up, the main pieces that stick out are the defense, three-point shooting, and experience. Dwight Howard, Rajon Rondo, Danny Green, and Javale McGee have been around the league for a while and it shows. On defense, this group is among the best in the league, averaging 7.1 blocks per game and giving up only 45.2 points in the paint, ranking first and seventh in respective categories. Watching just a few minutes of Howard, McGee, or Davis on defense and it is clear that they are seeking to shut down the paint.

On offense, this Lakers team is fun to watch. 113.5 points per game are good for eighth in the league. The Lakers are at their best on fast breaks or when they can work it down low, as 46.8% of their points come from the paint, the second-highest rate in the league. Combine that with a great outside shooting night and the Lakers can put up a lot of points in a hurry.

**The Bad**

In a recent blowout loss to the Celtics, it was obvious that the Lakers can get lazy on the defensive boards. Enes Kanter and Daniel Theis bullied the Lakers down low collecting offensive boards and easy second-chance points. The Lakers rank twenty-eighth in the league for opponents fast-break points with 15.8 per game and are twenty-second for defensive rebound percentage at 72.4%. A lazy defense can destroy a team, especially one that is susceptible to offensive dry-spells. This leads to the next bad part of the Lakers this season.

Despite the great play from AD and Lebron, they cannot play all forty-eight minutes every game and expect to be in great condition for the playoffs. Without Lebron on the floor, the Lakers often look lost on offense. Anthony Davis as the main scorer works well but without Lebron, it becomes easy to see that Lakers' gameplan will involve feeding Davis the ball. Kuzma is the only real bright spot on the bench but he cannot be relied upon to be the offensive focus when Lebron and Davis are out.

**The Ugly**

The worst part of this team is their bench. Kuzma and Caruso can be excellent at times and provide some good energy when the starters need a rest. Sometimes, however, the bench is stagnant on offense and this means lots of three-pointers, fade-aways, and little passing or movement. This is something that might be addressed with a free-agent acquisition or maybe by the trade deadline as Kyle Kuzma has been mentioned as a trading piece to acquire a player that better fills some other gaps on the team's roster.

**Playoff Prediction: NBA Champions**

The Lakers certainly have high expectations and they will be looking to play well into the playoffs. A deep run is likely for the Lakers and as the potential number one seed in the western conference, they will likely get a team with a losing record. Teams like the Grizzlies or the Spurs should be an easy first round. As of right now, I put the Lakers in the finals, beating out the eighth seed and then a couple more teams like the Clippers and Nuggets to win the western conference. I like them as finals favorites because their superstar duo can make the plays needed with the game on the line.
